# System Foxtrot REST

This application serves as the restful services as part of the overall https://github.com/jvalentino/sys-foxtrot project. For details system document, please see that location.

Prerequisites

- Java
- IntelliJ
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- pgadmin
- Git

All of these you can get in one command using this installation automation (if you are on a Mac): https://github.com/jvalentino/setup-automation

## Database

You launch the database container by running:

```
docker compose up -d
```

This sill executes the container in detached mode, and leave it running in the background.

## IDE Testing

This imports as a standard Gradle project, in which you are able to easily execute tests:

## Runtime

You can run the main class as a Spring Boot application:

## Verification

[![01](https://github.com/jvalentino/sys-alpha-bravo/raw/main/wiki/ide_check.png)](https://github.com/jvalentino/sys-alpha-bravo/blob/main/wiki/ide_check.png)

Running check will execute both testing and static code analysis via the build.

This is otherwise the same as doing this at the command-line: `./gradlew check`

## Strategy

Codenarc is used to ensure that no common coding issues can be added.

Jacoco is used to enforce that line coverage is over 85%.

Tests that end in "IntgTest" are used for integration testing via Spring Boot Test, otherwise they are unit tests.

Every code commit triggers a Github Action pipeline that runs the entire build process.
